<p>Dictionaries are organized lists of words and their associated definitions of all the languages of the world. All of them organized by sorting them alphabetically. Well now, let’s think through this. </p>

<p>The problem here is the Chinese don’t do “alphabetically” as don’t even have an alphabet. Yes you have seen westernized spelling of words (Ni Hao) , but this is a rather new thing and only used for the western world and is not taught in schools. This in turn, means they don’t have to spell - ever. Think of it: How many times have you wondered about the proper spelling of a word - wondering if the world will think of you as an idiot for using the wrong too to their or is it the e or a before -ccept. Let’s see I before E, or gh is silent, , or ... Nope, they don’t know this feeling. </p>
