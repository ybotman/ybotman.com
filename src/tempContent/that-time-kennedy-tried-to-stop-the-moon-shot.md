<p>Jan 20,1961. In a speech about the worries of communism and the concerns of future of US he stated :  "ask <strong>not </strong>what your <strong>country </strong>can do <strong>for you</strong>--<strong>ask </strong>what <strong>you </strong>can do <strong>for </strong>your <strong>country</strong>."   This formula of a phrase stick in hour heads, and is one  of the more American things ever uttered.</p>

<p>Nasa now knew a timeline and the difficulty of the mission. But one dicision keep everything else from truly being started:  <strong>The method and trajectory path to the Moon. </strong> Meaning, we could take 1 massive ship (thats what everyone thought) with all functions and features and go straight there and back. Or use could we fly up a 1 smaller ship and refuel it somehow move to another specialized ship. Or we could put a bunch of small things along the way with AIR, water, and fuel. Or do we use 1 single-ship with an impossible number of with many stages and separately functioning sub-ships (sounds horrible - but thats what we did).  This one mongo decision kept everything else from happening. <strong>  Nearly a year into the plan, </strong>NASA was<strong> still evaluating </strong>2 conflicting options. Without this marker, NOTHING could move forward. No ship designs, no sub-contractors, no bidding,  no fuel type, no material design, no spacesuit designs,  no timelines, no budgets, . . . etc. You get idea.</p>

<p>May, 1962. <strong>One year after Man,Moon speech,</strong> nothing was really moving forward, at least in the public sense. As the monstrous method and trajectory plan had not been finalized there was No ship design, no contractors, No markers had been met.  The US was slow and not fully on board, and Russia continued to make more and more successful space based milestones.</p>

<p>Sept 20, 1963:  Kennedy, in a speech at the United Nations, proposed that the Soviet Union and United States cooperate in mounting a mission to the moon. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<strong>Why</strong>, therefore, <strong>should man’s first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition</strong>? ...  Stating that "<strong>The clouds have lifted a little</strong>” in U.S.-Soviet relations, and declared “The Soviet Union and the United States, together with their allies, can achieve further agreements–agreements which spring from our mutual interest in avoiding mutual destruction.”</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Kennedy was shot 40 days later.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The US turmoil of assassination may have been more important to get public goal of the moon shot than anything else. It seared in our collective minds of the formula vision for being  <strong>" US GOAL =  Man + Moon + Decade" </strong>. Get a man to the moon, and return but the end of the decade. </p>
