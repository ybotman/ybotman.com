<p class="has-drop-cap">Some basics out of the way.  I'm not a physicist. As with many things in life i have feelings about, Im a wanna-be 'fill in the blank'.  Yet, I do follow the math where i can, understand its core importance to these strange subject, but lo, it is beyond my current limits.  For me its understood that the 'what and why things are . . .' must be math supported, or its a philosophy (another wanna subject for me) Indeed, most things quantum and relative, complety defy human logic -- and I am comfortable with that. <em> The universe is in no obligation to make since to me.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Black hole are simple. They don't have color or shape. doesn't really have a 'Heavy object' at the center. the event horizon   Generate enough mass that can collapse past the forces that keep matter apart and together, and bang, you got one. It's an object with enough energy (possible origin from matter, or there are other options) that can generate an event horizon. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The interior of a black hole is not fully understood. By interior i mean passing the mathematical defined event horizon radius. In fact, the idea of interior gets confusing as you go past the event horizon.  The insides of a Black Hole, while USED to be based on MATTER (like a big sun or many, many suns), do NOT have very packed matter (in the normal way a normal person thinks of) in side if it.  At the center of a black hole is what physicists call the "singularity," or a point where extremely large amounts of matter are crushed into an<strong> infinitely small amount of space</strong>.&nbsp; It seems likely that general relativity does not accurately describe what happens at at near the center of the black hole.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Infinitely small - Does this mean no space, a radius of zero? No. Infinitely is not a number either in the large or small direction. Infinitely small is BIGGER than zero.  So a Plank Radius size?   Well, a radius implies a distance. And as  "distance is extent of space between. . . ", and defined space is unclear near middle of  black hole, we come to some mathematical dead ends. Again,  It seems likely that current math does not accurately describe what happens at at near the center of the black hole.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">You may have heard of spinning black holes.  Movies love them, these are the things that you go through to get to another 'universe'.  They are cool, interesting and based, at least, on some science.  So, this object can spin - just like baseball. The weird question of "what is spinning" messes with my head - because the center nor the insides of a blackhole is not a 'rigid body' as the insides are not Matter.  Can a POINT spin?  No - it seems you need some distance to spin seems, to me. However rational energy (angular momentum)  can be there without a spin i suppose.  Angular Momentum without "something" spinning, just like i suppose a black hole is matter, with the matter squashed to 0 size. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">This brings up the question of the maximum rotational spin of a black hole. Can it logically go beyond a the speed light?  Because Its not a rigid body (like a ball), that seems that the logical concept of speed is not necessary followed.  For example, the opposite edges of our visible universe are moving away from us at speeds greater that light - but beware, they themselves are not moving faster than light - The spacetime created between is allowing that. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">So again i ask: Can the <em>logical </em>speed of the spin rate of a Black Hole exceed the speed of light?  I would like to know.</p>
