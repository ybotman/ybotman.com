<p>Ever since my Dad took me to a barbershop chorus rehearsal in 1975, i have adored the human voice. It was clear that thEse men were getting together ONLY because of the human voice. The sang together is corners and in hallways - wether they liked each other or not. It amazed me How vocal singing together brought so much joy to all forms a man captivated my mid at the age of 14. I did not see the parallel for trombone players or piano (both of which I played).  Indeed,  the voice and A-cappella has been a large part of my life and influenced how I see the world.</p>

<p>In college I spend a year with vocal anatomy and phonetics. I leanered how many sounds the human voice a pan make and how much we knew (and didnt) about how the human voice works. Later in life I studied what a voice is and the physics of sound. </p>

<p>Indeed the voice and sarcasm and how this translate to vocal inflections. I have thought about why other languages are hard to hear (even what a word is), but how a laugh of any age translates across all cultures. </p>

<p>The human voice is amazing - mostly because our human brains are so uniquely designed together, but it never ceases to confound my brain the subtleties of inflection</p>
