<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Which thinking are you :   Is God a thing, or is everything that <em>can </em>be known - everything that is?  Are there un-knowable things?  Is your conscience something <em>other </em>that the physical world or did it emerge from the things <em>of </em>the world?</p>

<p><strong>Materialism</strong>. Only the world of matter is real.   Nothing beyond what is physical is real. Everything else: thoughts, god, ideas, etc are only concepts.  &nbsp;There is no spirit or soul, divine God of any manner. Materialism builds conscience, perception, and will as a result the brain (or body)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dualism</strong>. There are 2 types of reality : Things that are material, and things that are immaterial.  Several forms can be presented:  In a religious context, The Soul, or god are part of the immaterial, but indeed real.  If belief in ghosts or spirts, then this also Dualism.  Indeed, even if your belief that your Mind is MORE than the sum of the atoms, neural connects and chemical signals, then this is a dualistic philosophy. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Idealism</strong>.  The entire world, all things physical are the product of the mind and awareness. The world is inseparable from the mind. </p>

<p>Physicalism is closely related to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism">materialism</a>. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena.
