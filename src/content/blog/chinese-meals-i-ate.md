# Chinese Meals I Ate on This Trip

Traveling through different parts of China, I tried some dishes that were both exciting and, for a newcomer, occasionally surprising. Here are a few highlights (or, depending on your taste buds, “fright-lights”) from my culinary adventure:

1. **Goose Web Feet**  
   Yes, goose *feet*. This time was served braised but ofen in a soup, these webbed delicacies are mostly about the **gelatinous texture**. If you can get over the look, the flavor can be quite rich, especially when seasoned with soy sauce, ginger, or star anise.

2. **Smelly Tofu**  
   The name says it all: it has a *very* strong smell, but the taste is milder than you might expect. Traditionally fermented, **smelly tofu** is often deep-fried and served with chili sauce or pickled vegetables. It’s an iconic street food that many locals *love*.

3. **“Cotton” Chicken**  
   This dish (possibly “poached” or “steamed” chicken, sometimes called “Bai Qie Ji”) is known for its **ultra-tender, silky texture**—almost cotton-like. Served cold or at room temperature, it’s often dipped in a ginger-scallion sauce. Simple, light, and all about the chicken’s natural flavor.

4. **Pork and Shrimp Paste Mixed with Ground Lotus**  
   A hearty mix that’s both savory and subtly sweet from the lotus root. The chopped lotus root gives a pleasant crunch, while **pork and shrimp** paste add depth of flavor. Typically shaped into patties or balls and pan-fried or steamed.

5. **Dried Oyster with Shrimp Paste**  
   Oyster and shrimp are strong flavors on their own; put them together, and you get a **briny, umami bomb**. Often cooked with a bit of sauce or veggies, this dish can be intense, but it’s a favorite for seafood lovers.

6. **Chicken Feet**  
   A staple in many dim sum restaurants, chicken feet (or “phoenix claws”) are usually **braised in a savory-sweet sauce** until soft and gelatinous. They’re high in collagen and definitely an acquired taste for some, but widely beloved by many locals.

7. **Fish Stomach and Bladder**  
   These are prized for their **spongy, gelatinous** texture and subtle, almost neutral flavor that soaks up the sauce or soup they’re cooked in. Considered a delicacy, they’re often served in hot pots or stews, where they absorb the rich broth.

8. **Duck Uterus**  
   An unusual item even for some locals, duck uterus is lauded for its **springy, crunchy bite** and is typically stir-fried with vegetables and spices. It can be a bit of a shock to first-timers, but adventurous eaters might enjoy its uniquely chewy texture.

9. **Deep Fried Milk**  
   A crazy dish makde iwth connetrated cow milk (like a thick yogart) mixed with Pandam leace and then gently rolled in a tempura like batter.  Then you guess it Deep fried.  Crazy good.

From the pungent aroma of smelly tofu to the surprising texture of fish stomach, these dishes remind me just how broad and varied Chinese cuisine can be. Each dish carries its own history, preparation style, and *fan base*. They may not all be for everyone, but each experience has expanded my appreciation for the depth and creativity of Chinese cooking.
