# The Speed of Light Is SO Slow

We often marvel at how **light travels at \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second**, zipping around Earth seven times in a single heartbeat. It only takes about two seconds to reach the Moon, eight and a half minutes to get from the Sun to us, and a few hours to touch Neptune. But zoom out to interstellar or intergalactic scales, and suddenly, that lightning-fast speed starts to feel **painfully slow**.

## Interstellar Delays
Our nearest star (beyond the Sun) is around **four to five light years** away. That means even the simplest “hello—how are you?” radio message would take about **five years** to get there and another five to get a response—**ten years** total. And you wouldn’t even know if they received the initial message until you got that reply (assuming they reply at all). 

## The Milky Way Gap
Now consider the **other side** of our own galaxy: distances can span **100,000 light years**. The signals we send could take 100 millennia to arrive—and another 100 millennia for a response. Whatever conversation we’re trying to have would be out of date by about **200,000 years** by the time we got a “Fine, thanks, and you?”

## Galaxy to Galaxy
And that’s just our galaxy. Across intergalactic space, we measure distances in **millions** or even **billions** of light years. Any back-and-forth communication at these scales becomes effectively impossible—**a cosmic snail mail** so slow that entire civilizations might rise and fall before a single message completes its round trip.

## Universe in Time, Not Miles
Because of these vast distances, astronomers often talk about the universe **in terms of time** rather than raw miles. When we see light from a galaxy two billion light years away, we’re looking two billion years into the past. Meanwhile, the universe keeps **expanding**, making the gaps even larger.

If the **speed of the universe**—a better name for the “speed of light”—were somehow faster, our universe would seem “smaller.” More of it would be accessible to us within a human lifespan. But in **our** reality, the speed limit is set, and it shapes what (and who) we can reach. It’s a sobering reminder that, on a cosmic scale, even the fastest thing we know can feel **frustratingly slow**.
