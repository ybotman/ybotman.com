# Anti-Matter Actually Falls Down

We (well not me, again) recently created **antimatter hydrogen**, consisting of a positron (the “positive” electron) orbiting a negatively charged proton. They trapped a bunch of this stuff in a **magnetic suspension cage** within a vacuum, then, wait for it,  switched off the field.

What happened? **It dropped.** Gravity behaved exactly the same on antimatter as it does on ordinary matter. Most researchers *expected* this result, but science is all about testing assumptions. If it *hadn’t* fallen, it would’ve flipped our understanding of physics upside down.

So, it’s not the most shocking outcome—but it’s still a **thrilling** confirmation that nature runs by rules we can trust. And who knows? The next experiment might reveal something that doesn’t behave so predictably.
