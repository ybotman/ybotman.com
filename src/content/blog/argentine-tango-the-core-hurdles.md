<h6>Most partner dances : swing, waltz, polka, square dancing, two step, and the vast majority, mostly focus on moves, body position, and patterns. Once learned, then partnership with someone "at your level" can be achieved.</h6>
<h6>Tango, in contrast, mostly focuses on awareness and "pairing thinking", Collaboration, and cooperative innovation and not on patterns. It's Not that other dances don't use these concepts, but rather Argentine tango is at its core an exploration of partnership.</h6>These core concepts are the major brain hurdles in Argentine tango.
