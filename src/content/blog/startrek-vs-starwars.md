<p><strong>On Science :</strong> <em> StarTrek wins hands down. </em> Star Wars doesn't even seem to try. Did the Wars even have a science consultant? &nbsp;Vibration of space explosions? Dodging those Blasters? The Kessel Run in 12 Parsecs?  Look, I'm ok with accepting a given world as the rules the director dictate to me, but the Hyperspace ramming scene that  . . . Please stop.</p>

<p><strong>On Comedy :</strong>  Both have their flavors of comedy. Some success and some failures. </p>

<p>Early Star Wars may have had a solid intelligent balance of its humor, but then the second set of movies brought us JarJar,  Wattoo, and the PodRace Commentors - ugh. Then, of course the newest StarWars under Disney (re: Last Jedi, etc) have gone off the rail (Luke : Throwing a lightsaber, Green teet-Milk,  horrible comic timing).   Sometimes, the new comedy even seems to break the 4th wall - or at least makes me laugh  'at the movie' rather than the story and event. Steady and progressive and now predictable downhill path.</p>

<p>Star Trek has had its comedic ups and downs as well, however its has solidly kept an attempt at historical humor relevance, and therefore <em>Star Trek wins</em></p>

<p><strong>On Story Telling:</strong>  Well, Star Wars is at its heart, more of a story device. The overarching good vs evil, and evolution of balance, and the forces there-in.  Star Trek is more episodic - even in movie form. Each star Track move can produce new conceptual villains, and untied stories.  While there are deep stories in Star Trek, Yup - <em>Star Wars Wins</em></p>
