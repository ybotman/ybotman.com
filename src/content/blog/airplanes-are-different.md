# Airplanes Are Different

I remember a time when **air travel** felt like a grand event. Families dressed up just to visit the airport; we’d park right near the gate, stroll down the concourse, and wait for our loved ones to appear off the plane. Pilots were *rockstars*, flight attendants were the very embodiment of adventurous elegance, and planes themselves symbolized the **pinnacle of progress**.

Fast-forward to today, and things have changed so radically it’s easy to forget the differences. One of the biggest surprises? 

**Planes used to be *loud***—loud enough to drown out conversation if they flew overhead. We’d have to *pause* dinner table chatter, phone calls, or a teacher’s lesson for frustrating few moments while the roar passed.

I like to picture a **“cone of silence”** trailing behind each plane, compelling everyone beneath it to pause their conversations for half a minute as it sweeps across the country.

Now, **modern aircraft** are quieter, bigger, more efficient, and so frequent in the skies that we barely notice them. Sure, flying isn’t always cheaper or roomier, but the noise factor? It’s practically night and day compared to decades past.

**We fly more, but talk about it less.** Airports are busier, security lines are longer, and many of us board planes for work trips without a second thought. That sense of grand occasion—of “I’ve made it” when work sends you to a conference—doesn’t feel quite as magical as it did back then.

While maybe we can't hold onto that **wonder**, we my be able to feel the sense **reassurance** of us humans with the continual push for little bits of progress. You acn see it every where you look. 

So, next time you see a plane overhead, think about how amazing it is that we’ve created these thunderous (but increasingly quiet) metal birds, carrying us across the globe in hours instead of days. Underneath all the routine and the hustle, it’s still a marvel of human achievement—just not the ear-splitting kind it used to be.
