<p> Bir Tawīl is an area of the earth near lower Egypt (according to Sudan) or upper Sudan,( according to Egypt).   This discrepancy comes from a disagreement of the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt (in yellow) asserts the political boundary , and Sudan (in blue) asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle (in green) is claimed by both and Bir Tawil (in white) by neither.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>Can you move there?  Probably, and if you can surive the conditions, it's yours.  You’ll probably need a visa for Egypt or Sudan to get there though, being land locked.  Getting food there might be tough. Water - even tougher. But here, you would be king or queen.  All you have to do is just convince a fair part of the world that is is yours and you can run it. There is not form, or process. Just form a government, get recognized, and you are the ruler. Some have tried, but no-one has passed muster.</p>
