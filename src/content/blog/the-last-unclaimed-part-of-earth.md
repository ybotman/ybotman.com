**Every inch** of the world belongs to *some* country—sometimes disputed by two or more nations. But there’s nowhere unclaimed . . . right?

**Wrong.** There’s a 795-square-mile (2,060-square-kilometer) patch of land that belongs to no one: **Bir Tawil**. You could, in theory, move there, claim it, and name yourself ruler—assuming you can survive in its harsh desert climate.

## Why No One Owns Bir Tawil
Bir Tawil lies near lower Egypt (per Sudan’s view) or upper Sudan (per Egypt’s view). The confusion goes back to two different boundaries:
1. A **straight political boundary** (1899).
2. An **irregular administrative boundary** (1902).

Egypt acknowledges one set of lines; Sudan acknowledges the other. The result? **Hala’ib Triangle** is claimed by both; **Bir Tawil** is claimed by neither. It’s essentially terra nullius—“no man’s land.”

## A Desert Climate
The region is scorching. Temperatures can top 104°F (40°C) for much of the year, sometimes hitting 113°F (45°C). Even the coolest months hover around 79°F (26°C). This is not exactly prime real estate—water and supplies would be a constant struggle.

## Could You Actually Live There?
In theory, yes—if you can handle survival in a desert with no resources. You’d also need an entry visa from either Egypt or Sudan, which ironically might not recognize your “new country.” Several explorers and would-be monarchs have tried to plant a flag, but none have gained any serious global acknowledgment.

## 50 Years From Now—Who Gets It?
It’s anyone’s guess if Bir Tawil will remain unclaimed forever. Maybe climate change or future diplomatic deals could make it relevant. For now, it’s a curious anomaly: a real chunk of Earth without an official owner.

As extreme as this land might be, it underscores one fascinating reality—**even in the 21st century, not every line on the map is settled.** If you’re bold (and a little crazy), perhaps you could carve out your own desert kingdom here. Just don’t expect an easy time convincing the rest of the world you’re legit. 

Who knows? Give it 50 years. Maybe someone figures out how to desalinate water cheaply, or invests in solar fields, and Bir Tawil becomes the next big thing—or stays a lonely patch of scorching sands.
