Star Trek TNG is about the world of 2370's or about 350 years in the future. An interesting mind experiment would be to Compare this world you and I are in to a world 350 year ago or 1670. What was this world like ? What is the trajectory or technology changes form there to now? Can we extrapolate to the future?

1670, or 350 years ago had a very different world. Newton thinking about laws of motion and science and physics coming into being. Bicycle have not been invented. The US colonies were stable but just thinking about becoming independent of England. Wars were slow and only occurred doing good weather and more people died from starvation that swords.
