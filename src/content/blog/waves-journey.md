# A Wave’s Journey

Picture a wave in the ocean. You can see it—measure its height, notice how the sunlight plays across its crest. You watch it move and say, “That’s a wave.”

Then it crashes onto the shore and disappears. 

Yet the water remains. 

The wave was just another way for the water to be—briefly visible, then gone. Finally, the wave returns to the ocean from which it came, finding itself back where it was always meant to be.

From 2020's TV show "The Good Place"
