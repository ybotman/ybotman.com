# Dialogue Without Words

Words can be powerful, but sometimes they fall short.  
**A picture** can paint a thousand of them.  
**A human touch**? Thatâ€™s worth a million.

In tango, we rely on this silent dialogue, or at least we hope to. 

The instantious sense of 'fear' or 'judgemnt' or 'oops', or 'next time' at any time  are deeper expressiions that any words can say - We both when they are present and can-not hide from them.  Self awareness and knowing them (without words) allow us to pass beyond them. 

For me with at least part of an engineering brain, and a deep-thinker, it indeed has been one of my tough tango hurdels.  To remove the thinking, the 'wording' brain. To accept everything and conquer all that is not a partnership.

# We can sense more that we can say. Lean into the silence. Its deafening.
