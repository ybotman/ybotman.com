<p>Books. They’re supposed to be gateways to adventure, knowledge, and escapism. Yet, here I am, staring at a mountain of them that I can’t seem to part with. From high school novels to college textbooks, beloved reads to ones I despise, and even that old 1990 database design manual—why can’t I just let them go? Let’s dive into the quirky, cluttered world of my book collection and explore the tangled web of emotions and memories that keep these pages from finding a new home.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Mixed Bag of Memories</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My bookshelf is a colorful chaos of emotions and memories. I’ve got books from high school that I both loved and hated. Remember that one novel you couldn’t put down and the other you couldn’t wait to finish just to throw it away? Yeah, I’ve got both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>High School Hits and Misses:</strong> There are those coming-of-age stories that shaped who I am and the textbooks that made me question why I ever thought chemistry was cool.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>College Classics:</strong> From enlightening literature to the dreaded 1990 database design book that still sits untouched, wondering why I can’t just bid it farewell.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Love-Hate Relationship with Books</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some books have a special place in my heart, while others… not so much. It’s a delicate balance of sentiment and practicality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Books I Love:</strong> These are the ones that made me laugh, cry, and think deeply. They’re like old friends I can’t imagine my shelf without.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Books I Hate:</strong> The ones that caused eye-rolls and groans every time I glanced at them. Yet, they’re still here, stubbornly occupying space.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Books I Won’t Read Again:</strong> Finished them but can’t bring myself to let them go. It’s like keeping a trophy for something you no longer care about.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Unread and the Unwanted</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there are the books I want to read someday but haven’t gotten around to yet. They’re like potential adventures waiting patiently on the shelf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Books I Want To Read:</strong> The titles that promise new insights or thrilling stories, but somehow always stay in the “someday” pile.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Books I Recall:</strong> Some I remember vividly, and others? Not so much. The memory of why I bought that 1990 database design book is fuzzy at best.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Great Book Hoarding Mystery</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, why can’t I throw these books away when I can easily part with other clutter like clothes, shoes, dishes, or art pots?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Let’s not forget the beauty of a well-stocked bookshelf. It’s like a personal library that showcases my intellectual journey.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
