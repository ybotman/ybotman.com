<p class="has-drop-cap">A. The universe is emergent.  All forms of awareness and the things we see (and don't) are of the things that eventually will be known. Awareness and Consciousness are create-able (not today, but someday), by some quantum computer thingy. Feeling of consciousness arise from some process. All things knowable.  </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">B.  If one could create a consciousness-like awareness in a  computer that is indistinguishable from 'real' awareness.  This thing would act and be aware.  But in realty it is a zombie and not really aware. This can even question whether anyone other than yourself is real.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">C. There are non-computational problems and therefore to comprehend the problem require something non-computation. So at least our intelligent consciousness COULD NOT have emerged from complexities of the universe.  Understanding purely Mathematical understanding requires more than emergent universe. Understanding problem is <em>not </em>something that can be reduced to something computable. Chess and Go computers don't understand chess, but can beat us, while we believe at least we understand the games. So,  if physical laws are mathematical at their essence (rather than just perfectly <em>described </em>by math), then we our understands will continue to grow to know more of the universe.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">D.    Dualism.  There is something "ELSE" in our universe, and cannot be fully comprehended, as it is out of our existence - like God, spirt, or Soul. Indeed the best we COULD achieve is the FACT that there are things that are <em>known</em> to be <em>unknowable.</em> These are things that are required to "BE" but cannot be directly studied by science.  The more we study something, the more we know about the knowable, but not the un-knowable. In some cases, this OTHER universe can interact with OUR world but not both ways</p>
