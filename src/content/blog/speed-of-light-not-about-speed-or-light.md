# The Speed of Light Is Not About Speed (or Light)

We tend to think of the “speed of light” like a car flying down a highway—just a very, very fast one. But light isn’t a little photon bullet racing through space in the way we imagine. It’s more about how **our universe communicates with itself**.

**Energy transfer**—whether it’s light, electromagnetic waves, or any signal—propagates through spacetime at a fundamental rate. That rate isn’t arbitrarily set by light; it’s baked into the very **fabric of the universe**. You could call it “the universal speed limit,” the maximum speed at which any information can travel.

In other words, the speed of light is better understood as **the speed of how reality interacts with itself**. The reason we associate it with light is simply because light (in a vacuum) travels at that fundamental limit. If, hypothetically, the fabric of the universe allowed a faster rate of interaction, then we’d have a different “speed of light.”

So it’s not about literal **speed** in the everyday sense, and it’s not really just about **light**. It’s about the **communication limit** embedded in spacetime itself—the maximum rate at which cause and effect can ripple through reality.
