# Passwords: Best Practices

**Stop trying to remember them**—you can’t, because you’re human. Every password you use (and let’s be real, we all have over 100 logins these days) should be different and *truly random*. Any clever trick, like reversing a word or swapping letters with symbols, is easily cracked by modern brute-force methods.

## Don’ts

- **Don’t** use any recognizable word or anything spelled backward.  
- **Don’t** just tack on “01” for the new version (“02” for the next...).  
- **Don’t** assume a simple letter-to-symbol substitution (like `$` for `S` or `@` for `A`) will fool anyone.  
- **Don’t** rely on your browser’s built-in password memory—especially not on a shared or easily compromised device.  

## How Computers Hack Your Accounts

1. **Password Brute Force**  
   Hackers can guess *billions* of possibilities per second if they have your account’s hashed password. If your password is under 8 characters, it can be cracked almost instantly. Even 14 characters might only buy you hours. At 20+ characters, you’re looking at years or millennia—assuming today’s hardware. But as computers get faster, you need to stay one step ahead.

2. **Password Hash Comparison**  
   Once hackers have a list of hashed passwords (from a database breach, for example), they can quickly match them against known hash patterns. Unique, random passwords for each site help limit the damage if one set of credentials leaks.

3. **Keystroke Copiers**  
   Keyloggers or malware on your device can record every password you type. This is why using unknown machines (like at an airport) is so risky.

## The One Golden Rule

**Use a password manager.** Whether it’s LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, or Keeper—pick one and **stick** with it. Let it generate 20+-character random passwords for every single account. You only remember one strong master password; the manager handles the rest.

I personally started with LastPass and recently switched to **1Password** after trust issues arose. Yes, it can feel like a pain, but it’s infinitely safer than reusing the same eight-character password. It’s your best bet to avoid a GPU-based brute force fiasco or a simple dictionary attack.

## Accept the (Mild) Inconvenience

- I memorize my master password, my phone’s PIN, and my computer’s screensaver login.  
- *Everything else*? Random strings that only my password manager knows.  

Sure, **there’s still risk**—keyloggers, zero-days, or state-sponsored hacks exist. But at least you won’t get hammered by a simple brute force or guesswork attack. And if one site gets compromised, your other 152 logins remain safe behind their own unique walls. It’s all about **making it harder** for hackers, one step at a time.
