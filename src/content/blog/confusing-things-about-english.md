The alarm <strong>goes off</strong> when the sound of the clock wakes you and when it is sounding its alarm, you also <strong>turn it off</strong>  to stop the sounds. At night you turn the alarm <strong>on</strong>, when you <strong>set</strong> it. Knowing it will <strong>go off </strong>in 8 hours.

A plane <strong>takes off </strong>when it is going fast enough to rise in the air. Strange indeed , so why does it not <strong>take on </strong>when it lands?

You Get <strong>in</strong> a cab, <strong>on</strong> a train, <strong>board</strong> a plane and boat.. You don't <strong>board</strong> a cab, get <strong>in</strong> a plane or boat , or get <strong>on</strong> a train. You <strong>Take</strong> an Uber. (Yes. Jerry Seinfeld).

You can <strong>throw up</strong> and <strong>wake up</strong> but then a<strong> Throw down</strong> and<strong> wake down</strong> are meaningless or not too similar at all.

Did you know that December used to be the 10th month? What changed?  You know that Duo is a prefix for things of 2, and quad is a prefix for things of 4.  So, let's continue - If sept/hept = 7 (as in Septuagenarian. and heptagon), oct = 8 (as in octagon),   and  dec= 10 (as in decimeter and decade). We did skip nov as it used to mean things of 9 from the greek, it now only means 'new' as in novel, and novice from latin).  The calendar system was reorganized and theses mothes we're renamed bu Julias Ceaser (July), and August Ceaser (Augoust), so then the 9th month is September, 10th is October 11th is November and 12th is December.

<h1 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; text-align: center;"> UP</h1>
<h4 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; text-align: center;">Let us  just stick with the word "UP"  ONLY the word "Up".</h4>
&nbsp;
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">We must speak UP in order to bring UP a topic.  Then it's UP to the secretary to write UP a report (unless she can think UP an excuse).

We call UP our friends and ask them to come UP for dinner.  For them, we brighten UP the room, and we polish UP the silver, hoping they've worked UP an appetite.  We mess UP the kitchen cooking UP a meal and using towels to soak UP spills.  Afterward, we have to clean UP, and the next day, we warm UP the leftovers.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">Sometimes, guys lock UP their house, line UP to buy parts, and then fix UP their old cars.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">Politicians stir UP trouble, especially when they're UP for election.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">To be dressed is one thing, but to be dressed UP is something special!</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP.  If your can of Drano is empty, it's all used UP.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">We open UP a store in the morning, but at night we close UP shop.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">If it looks like rain, we say it is clouding UP.  When the sun comes out, we say it is clearing UP.  When it rains, some things get wet and may end UP being all rusted UP.  But when it doesn't rain for a while, then everything dries UP.  And in the winter, things can freeze UP!
We seem to be pretty mixed UP about "UP"!  If you want to know more about "UP," look it UP in the dictionary.  It may take UP a fourth of the page, and can add UP to about thirty definitions!</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">If you are UP to it, you might try building UP your own list of the many uses of "UP."  It will take UP a lot of your time, but if you don't give UP, you may wind UP with more than a hundred!</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; caret-color: #333333; color: #333333;">I could go on and on, but my time is UP.  I'm going to wrap it UP by shutting UP!

Now—you can forward this note, or you can just delete it—it's UP to you!</p>
