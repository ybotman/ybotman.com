# Curious Quirks in Everyday Language

## Alarms & Planes
- An **alarm** goes *off* when it starts making noise, and you turn it *off* to stop the sound. But at night, you turn the alarm *on* to ensure it’ll wake you in the morning.
- A **plane** takes *off* when it’s fast enough to lift into the air. Oddly, it doesn’t “take on” when it lands.

## Getting On or In?
- You “**get in** a cab” or “**take** an Uber,” but you “**get on** a train,” “**board** a plane,” and “**board** a boat.” Jerry Seinfeld famously joked about these quirky prepositions.
- You can “**throw up**” or “**wake up**,” yet “throw down” and “wake down” hardly make sense.

## The Calendar Shuffle
- December (literally “the tenth month” from the prefix **dec-**) used to be the 10th month in an older Roman calendar.  
- Likewise, **September** (sept-/hept- = 7), **October** (oct- = 8), **November** (nov- = 9), and **December** (dec- = 10) originally matched those numbers.  
- Over time, **Julius Caesar** introduced July (named after himself) and **Augustus Caesar** added August. This pushed the other months further down, so what used to be the 9th month (September) is now actually the **9th** in name but the **9th**. . . wait, that’s confusing—but hey, blame the ancient emperors for rearranging everything!

## The Magic of "Up"
Let’s shine a spotlight on just **one word**: **UP**. It’s everywhere—check out these examples:

- We must **speak UP** to **bring UP** a topic. Then it’s **UP** to someone else to **write UP** a report (unless they can **think UP** an excuse).
- We **call UP** our friends, ask them to come **UP** for dinner, brighten **UP** the room, and polish **UP** the silver—hoping they’ve **worked UP** an appetite.
- We might **mess UP** the kitchen cooking **UP** a meal and use towels to **soak UP** spills. Then we **clean UP** the mess, and the next day we **warm UP** the leftovers.
- Sometimes, people **lock UP** their house, **line UP** to buy parts, then **fix UP** an old car.
- Politicians often **stir UP** trouble, especially when they’re **UP** for election.
- Being dressed is one thing, but being **dressed UP** is something special!
- A drain can be **stopped UP**, so we have to **open UP** the drain. If the can of Drano is empty, it’s all **used UP**.
- We **open UP** a store in the morning, and **close UP** at night.
- If it looks like rain, it’s **clouding UP**. When the sun comes out, it’s **clearing UP**. If it rains on metal, it might **rust UP**. When there’s no rain, things **dry UP**, and in the winter, they can **freeze UP**!
- Curious, right? If you **look UP** “up” in the dictionary, it may **take UP** a quarter of the page and **add UP** to about thirty definitions.
- If you’re **UP to it**, try **building UP** your own list of ways we use “up.” It’ll **take UP** a lot of time, but if you don’t **give UP**, you may **wind UP** with more than a hundred!

I could go on, but my time is **UP**. I’m going to **wrap it UP** by **shutting UP**! Whether you **forward** this note or **delete** it, well—that’s **UP** to you.
