# Phatic Phrases: How Are You?

We say it countless times a day—“How are you?”—but **do we really want the answer**? In most casual encounters, the question is more of a social lubricant, a **phatic phrase** that smooths interactions. We’re signaling friendliness, not necessarily diving into deep emotional territory.

## My Answer to “How Are You?”
Usually something like “Hungry,” or “Ready for my closeup” with a wink—just to mess with the script. It’s fun to watch the other person’s reaction. I’m not actually revealing how I truly feel, but I’m keeping the rapport intact.

**Phatic communication** is about **building connection**—it’s a ritual that acknowledges another person without demanding real depth. In some cultures, the go-to question might be “Have you eaten?” or “All good?”—the wording changes, but the *function* stays the same: a quick social handshake.

## A Friendly Wrap-Up
So, “How are you?”.... While usually it’s just a casual hello; one mustant crowbar a conversation, but I **love** to use it as an opportunity (on occastion) to peel the onion a bit. To stand-out a bit in the answer. A giggle or smile or a little deeper connection just may happen.
