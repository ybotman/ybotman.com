<p class="">We don't often think twice about Disgust.  But why is it a thing vs just to avoid a bad thing. But when and how do we learn to be disgusted by gross things?   Indeed when did it become tied to an emotional thing.  What things that are disgusting are universally human (and what are they), and what about cross species?   Indeed, when did disgust become a thing?</p>
