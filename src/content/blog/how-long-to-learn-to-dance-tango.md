<p>However, we can make some goals and assumptions. So, if you want to be able to go to a new Tango Event (A Milonga) and ask (or be asked by) someone to dance, and not feel like a idiot dancing? This means dealing with the basics of the Tango (Balance, Embrace, and Cadencia, etc), having a few inventory of moving techniques, and the ability of basic floor navigation. </p>

<p>My experience, is that most ' fairly focused people' (with no dance experience) can be basically proficient in about a half year or so as long as you are taking regular (weekly) lessons, and practicing outside that week. At that point one should be feeling reasonably comfortable on the floor, with most partners, and you should feel you have started down the tango life.</p>
