There’s little in life where two people are brought together in such a unique, singular way to create something random, collaborative, and beautiful. Most of life is about doing what we are asked or asking someone to do something—work, drive, raise kids, etc. We meet, share space, and time, but in tango, we share space, time, and **product** in real time. When I dance tango, it’s like nothing else—an experience where judgment disappears, and something magical happens.

Tango isn’t about strict rules or rigid steps. There’s no blame when it doesn’t go as planned, because there was never a rigid plan to begin with. **It’s a dance where failure doesn’t exist, only evolution.** If something goes wrong, it’s not about fault. It’s about collaboration, learning, and continuing the flow together.

Tango is not a **"do this, and then do that"** dance. It’s not about being told what to do and doing it. **It’s a dialogue.** It’s a suggestion from one partner, a listening response from the other, and then a shared evolution. It’s an invitation to move together, to adapt, to communicate without words, and to solve whatever comes naturally in the moment.

It’s not like flipping a switch—one partner leads, and the other follows. No, tango is more like a **dimmer switch**, where the colors change, and both partners have their hands on the dial. The dance isn’t controlled by one; it’s shaped by both. We shift, adapt, and evolve, together. We both influence the rhythm, the mood, the movement, and the pace.

When else in life do we get to hold someone without worry, without expectation, and truly collaborate? Tango is not about **give and take**. It’s a **merger**. It’s a beautiful partnership where both people are equal contributors, shaping something greater than either could do alone. It’s pure connection, pure collaboration.

And that’s why I dance tango.
