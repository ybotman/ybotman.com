# Hong Kong Does Escalators Right

There’s an unspoken efficiency in Hong Kong: **stand on the right, walk on the left.** Whether you’re in a busy MTR station or a towering shopping mall, everyone seems to follow this rule—no signs required. The result? A smooth, stress-free flow of people that almost feels choreographed.

When I first arrived, my father-in-law wasted no time making sure I fell in line—literally. Stand on the right if you want to ride. Move to the left if you’re in a hurry. It's a small courtesy that shows huge respect for **everyone’s** time and space. And just like that, **I got it**. Now, I can’t imagine escalators any other way.

So yes, Hong Kong absolutely **does** escalators right, and after a quick lesson, I’m doing them right too.

**My Father in law made sure of it**
