<p class="">We all know Facebook as a place to connect with friends, share photos, and catch up on the latest news. But have you ever stopped to think about what you’re actually giving away every time you log on? Let’s dive into what Facebook gets from you—and why it matters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class=""><strong>Your Data: More Than Just Likes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">Every like, comment, and share contributes to Facebook’s vast data pool. Your posts, your photos, the pages you follow, and even the times you’re online—all of this creates a detailed picture of who you are. Facebook uses this data to tailor ads, suggest friends, and show you content that keeps you hooked. But it’s not just about selling ads. This data can be shared with third parties, used to influence your opinions, and even predict your behavior.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Who Gets Your Data?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">Facebook’s primary business model is selling targeted advertising. Advertisers pay Facebook to show their ads to users who are most likely to be interested in their products. This targeting is made possible by the detailed profiles Facebook creates based on your data. But it doesn’t stop there. Facebook also shares data with third-party companies, which can include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Advertisers:</strong> They use your data to create targeted ad campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Developers:</strong> Apps you use through Facebook can access your information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Data Brokers:</strong> Companies that compile data from various sources to build comprehensive consumer profiles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Researchers:</strong> Academic and commercial researchers might access anonymized data for studies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Partner Companies:</strong> Businesses that work with Facebook to enhance their own services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">These partnerships can sometimes lead to controversial data practices, as seen in cases like the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where personal data was used for political profiling.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Privacy: The Illusion of Control</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">You might think you’re in control of your privacy settings, but the reality is more complex. Even with the strictest settings, your information can still be accessed in ways you might not expect. For instance, when your friends use certain apps, those apps can access data about you too. It’s a web of connections that’s hard to navigate, making true privacy a challenge.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Mental Health: The Subtle Impact</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">Scrolling through endless posts can take a toll on your mental health. Seeing a curated version of other people’s lives might make you feel inadequate or envious. The constant influx of information can be overwhelming, leading to anxiety and stress. It’s important to recognize these feelings and take steps to manage your mental well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class=""><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Review Settings:</strong> Regularly check your privacy settings and be aware of what you’re sharing and with whom.  SHARE MINIMALLY.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">• <strong>Be Mindful:</strong> Take note of how much time you spend on Facebook and how it makes you feel. If it’s more negative than positive, it might be time to cut back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class=""><strong>Conclusion: Awareness is Key</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">Facebook isn’t just a social platform; it’s a powerful data-collecting machine. By being aware of what you’re giving away—your data, privacy, time, and mental health—you can make more informed decisions about how you use it. So next time you log on, remember you’re not just sharing with friends; you’re sharing with Facebook and therefor the money grabbing world which uses your clicks to control more that you know.</p>
