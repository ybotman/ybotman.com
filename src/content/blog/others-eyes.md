# Each Other’s Eyes

“Look through the other’s eyes—because yours aren’t the only ones that matter.”

We forget, sometimes, that the world doesn’t revolve around our personal lens. Another perspective might be just as valid—maybe even more enlightening. When we pause to see from someone else’s viewpoint, we slip into a deeper empathy that can break down assumptions and resentment.

It’s a small act—shifting to another set of eyes. 
Let us not be good at explaining your own view, but first understanding thier view (and its inhearant beauty).  Then and only then if needed,  see what your view is in thier eyes. 


*I think it can change everything.*
