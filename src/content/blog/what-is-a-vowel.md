<p class="has-drop-cap">We all know this - right? A, E , I, O , U. I know but, what makes a vowel a vowel? We know, shape your mouth rights, and the vowel comes out. But, what is going on when your mouth shape changes?  What is going on with the physics of the sound?  Then ,  how does our brain know its an A?  Physically whatâ€™s going on?  </p>

<p style="background-color:#d6f3ff" class="has-background has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">First some basic science-ey stuff out of the way:  A small deep dive on the physics of <em><strong>Sound</strong></em>, <em><strong>Pitch</strong></em>, and the <em><strong>Harmonic Series</strong></em> and how humans hear them. Then let us look at how to see these things in a special tool called a <em><strong>Spectrogram</strong></em>.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-left"><strong>Sound </strong>is air pressure as a waves (higher followed by lower pressure) moving through the air (or any medium).  The air is not 'moving' as a <em>breeze</em> moves, rather only the compressed / uncompressed sections move.  The analogy is how an ocean waves move horizontally, but the water moliecules only moves up and down. A breeze is akin to water current, which does moves horizontally.    <em>Ocean waves</em> move horizontally WITHOUT moving any water in the direction of the wave. Same with sound: The air does not move in the direction of the sound, but rather only the <em>pressure wave </em>moves. The animation from the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/centres/isvr.page">Institute of Sound and Vibration Research</a> shows  RED "pressure source" (speaker, trumpet, or bell) creating a sound wave being generated in  the compressible medium of black dots. Any black dot does not move much at all, but the wave does. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong>Pitch </strong>is the mapping of a frequency of the wave to a musical based name like 'B-Flat'. Remember the<strong> </strong>wave (the moving compression of the black dots) is going is at 761.2 mph (speed of sound at sea level) and does <em>not</em> ever change speed (so long as the temperature or density, etc, does not change). In looking at the animated gif, to change PITCH, the RED pressure source has to move back of forth faster - more times a second - and therefore (by definition), changes the frequency of the sound being produced. Because the SPEED of the wave does not change, the pitch can be measured as number of times a second the pressure wave crosses a point : its FREQUENCY. In additional affect, the distance from the top' of a wave to the 'top' of the will be has to be closer to one another (the WAVELENGTH). Note that the animation demos the WAVELENGTH (the physical distance from wave top to top).You can see how they are very similar. Its not really important but the mathematical relationship is Frequency = 1/Wavelength. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong>Harmonic Series</strong>&nbsp;is the sequence of pure sinusoidal tones, in which the frequency&nbsp;of each sound is a&nbsp;multiple of the lowest frequency (or fundamental). This is measured in cps (cycles per second or Hz (Hertz). These measures are identical : cps = Hz.  So, in the above example, 1 wave per second (1Hz) is the fundamental and is also 1 Hz. The  the first harmonic is 2x or 2Hz, the second karmic is 3Hz, etc.  If the above fundamental was 9hz, then the first harmonic would be 18Hz, and the second would e 27Hz, the third would be 36Hz, etc.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong>Spectrograms </strong>display a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound as they vary with time.&nbsp;The orange spectrogram example shows 2 pitches (a low, then a high pitch) played one after another (going left to right), producing a dozen or more of the harmonic series. The fundamental pitches are at the bottom-most bright lines, with the other harmonics (1st to 15th and more ) going <em>up </em>the graph. A spectrogram is great tool to see sound frequencies, the fundamental and its harmonic series. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When sounds are generated </strong>by much of the stuff in the world around us (voices, trombone, violins, bells, car engine, or a dropped fork) also simultaneously generate, a generous harmonic series (each on a multiple of the fundamental). So, a single note played from a Trombone produces a dozen (and more) pitches. But we don't really hear these notes as separate distinct notes. Read on.</p>

<p><strong>Now here's is what is amazing: </strong> When it comes to the hearing the <em>harmonic series played together</em>, OUR BRAINS<strong> DO NOT HEAR</strong> them as INDIVIDUAL PITCHES - it only identifies the LOWEST note (which is the fundamental) as the PITCH.  Let me re-phrase: If I play the a set of 20 pure sinusoidal notes (all harmonic series related) from 20 different speakers, you will only hear 1 low note. Yes, your brain will <strong>not be able </strong>to distinguish the other 19 pitches.  Its a little like how you can't see Blue mixed with Yellow paint as a<em> Blueish-Yellow,</em> but your brain sees a <em>green</em>. While your brain does not hear the non-fundamental parts of a harmonic series as individual tones, it doesn't ignore them . . . </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vowels are created by changing and managing FORMANTS.  <strong>A Formant</strong> is the 'spectral shaping' that results from the manipulation of the human vocal tract effects on the harmonic series produced in the human voice.  The vocal tract can be considered to have 2 'shape-able'  containers/tubes of air. Each air-container vibrates with specific resonance frequency areas.  As you change vowels, you change the shape of these 2 air pockets/containers (shorter- longer, wider-thiner), and as such, one is changing the RESONANCE characteristics of all  sounds that pass within them.  When the vocal tract's air containers change shape, each and every produced pitches (fundamental and harmonic series) are either to become resonant (like gentle pushing of a swing at the right time) or is dampened (like pushing at the wrong time).</p>

<p>Let's call the first area <strong>Container 1</strong>, and it is the&nbsp;<strong>air behind the tongue</strong>. From the top of the larynx to the hump of the tongue.  <strong>Formant 1</strong>&nbsp;is the<strong>&nbsp;pitches of the air</strong>&nbsp;that vibrates in container 1. </p>

<p><strong>Container 2</strong>&nbsp;- the<strong>&nbsp;air above and in front of the tongue</strong>. From the hump of the tongue to the tip of the lips. <strong>Formant 2</strong>&nbsp;is the<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;pitches of &nbsp;the air</strong>&nbsp;that vibrates in container 2.</p>

<p>A VOWEL is a clear distinction of the formants (mostly the first and second).  Examples of the VOWEL 'spectral shape' is shown in the black and white spectragram.  The information that humans require to distinguish between vowels can be represented quantitatively by the frequency content of the vowel sounds. Note the F1 and F2 identification. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is my voice sliding up then down, first on an EEE (as in 'eat' or 'pea'), and then n AHHH (as in a 'far' or 'Car')  The very BOTTOM RED line is the ONLY PITCH you will hear.  All the other lines (while they are real notes) , are not HEARD as distinct notes, but rather get interpreted as vowel characteristics.  Note that there is yellow/light-green background "BANDING" of some highlighted areas showing some spectral shaping, and are the resonant areas the vocal tract as allowed to be resonant. The first EEE has a diminished area just below 2000Hz, and a highlighted area just above 2000Hz.  The AHHH has nearly an opposite effect at the 2000Hz boundary.   You will hear one note, and all these other 'notes groupings' are UNDERSTOOD by the BRAIN to be vowels.  Different patterns of spectral shape become each distinct vowel.  EACH vowel has a<em> specific spectral shape,</em>  independent of pitch, created by managing the formants in the vocal tract.</p>

<p style="font-size:21px"><strong>OK,</strong> let's wrap this up.   All human vowels are created by managing (in the vocal tract) the formants and the relation to the spectral shape.  The first 2 formants are by far the most important for basic identification. Here is a mapping of the VOWELS against the first and second formant areas. </p>
