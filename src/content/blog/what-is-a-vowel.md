# What is a Vowel?

We often say “A, E, I, O, U,” but **what makes a vowel a vowel?** It’s more than just the shape of the mouth or a simple list of letters. At a fundamental level, vowels arise from **sound waves** passing through the vocal tract—specifically, **two adjustable air containers** behind and in front of the tongue. When you speak, these containers change shape, affecting how sound resonates.

## Sound, Pitch, and Harmonics

1. **Sound** is basically a pressure wave moving through air. Think of it like ocean waves: water doesn’t travel across the ocean, but the wave moves over it. Similarly, air doesn’t rush forward; the wave (higher and lower pressure) does.
2. **Pitch** is how frequently these waves hit your ear, measured in Hertz (cycles per second). If the wave source vibrates faster, you hear a higher pitch.
3. **Harmonics** occur because many objects (including your voice) produce waves at multiple frequencies simultaneously. Although a single note might have a “fundamental” pitch, there are additional overtones above it. Your brain usually merges these into one perceived sound.

## Formants: The Key to Vowels
When we talk about “vowel sounds,” we’re really talking about **formants**—areas of strong resonance in the vocal tract. By moving your tongue and lips, you alter the frequencies that get amplified or dampened. Each vowel has a distinctive “spectral shape,” mostly defined by the **first two formants (F1 and F2)**. No matter the pitch you sing or speak at, you’ll recognize a vowel based on these formant patterns.

### Why We Don’t Hear All Those Extra Tones
Even though your voice produces a fundamental tone plus many harmonics, your brain simplifies all that information into a single perceived note. It identifies which frequencies stand out to form the character of a vowel—rather than hearing each harmonic as a separate note.

## Wrapping Up
A vowel isn’t just about the letter on the page—it’s about how the vocal tract shapes the **harmonic series** produced by your voice. By adjusting formants, you create the difference between an “A” and an “E,” regardless of pitch. In other words, **managing your formants is what makes vowels sound like vowels**.

So next time you speak or sing, remember that vowels are created by **resonance in the air pockets** of your mouth and throat, shaped by small shifts in your tongue and lips. It’s a fascinating blend of physics, biology, and perception—all wrapped into the simple act of saying “A, E, I, O, U.”
