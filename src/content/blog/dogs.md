<p><strong>Dogs</strong>. They are amazing. I suppose its because we created them to be amazing, but still they are. If we humans didn't succeed in making them amazing thousands of years ago, then they would just be wolves. So in part, they are amazing because they have the <em>genes </em>that allowed them to have a fast guided evolution to our best friend as well us us choosing the attributes that made them amazing to us in our own eyes.  Still they are amazing. </p>

<p>Indeed, we have tried and failed to simply tame some animals (Zebra, moose, raccoons) and failed to evolve many others (Coyotes, fish, cats). Why dogs then? Interestingly, we did domesticate foxes but could not find a <em>use </em>for them, so most of those lines died off (there are some deomestiated pet foxes around). Interestingly, these domesticated foxes are more catlike than dogs despite being a canine line - Domesticate a Wolf - you get doglike creatures - evolving to dog species, Domesticate a Fox you get catlike creature. </p>

<p>So it seems that DOGS are amazing because we <strong>humans may have evolved because of our mutual successes </strong>and therefore in who and what we are<strong>, </strong>just as they are directly different because of us.created them to be amazing, but still they are.</p>
