# Holy Forking Shirt Balls— This the Bad Place.

Sometimes, you wake up and wonder: *Am I actually in the bad place?* Because let’s face it, life can hurl flaming dodgeballs at your face with no warning. 
Coffee spills, traffic, weather, political termoil and unrest, world disorder, and your computer decides now is the perfect time to update…

Its just a giant frozen yogurt machine.

(Refernces to the good place)
