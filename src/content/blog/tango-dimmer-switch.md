# A Dimmer Switch, Not On/Off

In tango, **nothing** is simply “yes or no.” Each move is a subtle progression—like sliding a dimmer switch from low to bright.

1. **The Offer**  
   The leader begins gently, a small suggestion, low and slow. No immediate commitment—just an invitation.

2. **Restating the Offer**  
   The follower *feels* this suggestion and signals understanding, often with a slight shift or pause. It’s not a formal “yes” yet, but a readiness to engage.

3. **Turning Up the Dimmer**  
   Sensing the follower’s openness, the leader amplifies the energy: “Let’s go a bit bigger.” The follower responds in kind, matching the growing momentum.

4. **Commitment to the Step**  
   Eventually, there’s a moment where the follower fully steps—completing the conversation. The leader receives this final answer and supports it.

5. **Repeat**  
   With that step done, they begin the process anew—offer, restatement, turning up, and acceptance. Over and over, each phrase in the dance flows seamlessly into the next.

This is why tango isn’t an on/off switch. It’s a **continuous negotiation** of possibility, each move evolving from a gentle spark into a shared, confident step.


# And in regular life, this is a good thing, too.
