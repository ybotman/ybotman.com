# Things We Don’t Know: The Matter-Antimatter Mystery

According to our best theories, the universe should have equal amounts of **matter** and **antimatter**—like digging a hole and piling the dirt nearby. One pile, one hole, net zero. But that’s not what we see. Instead, we live in a universe dominated by matter, with only tiny traces of antimatter around.

This means **WE SHOULD NOT EXIST** (now this time i include me and you).  Yet here we are reading and writing a blog. 

 In principle, matter and antimatter should have annihilated each other, leaving nothing behind. Obviously, that’s **not** what happened, and we **don’t** know why. It’s one of the biggest open questions in physics and cosmology: *What caused the universe to tip in favor of matter?*

I am amazed my the folks who tireless think through the thousands and thoudns of tinly logical steps (with only a few who can tryly understand the real meanings).  What is the begining and end of the universe, how does gravity work, what is the math of primes, etc. This one is a biggie - good luck on this one.
