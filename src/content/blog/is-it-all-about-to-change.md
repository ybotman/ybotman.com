<p class="">The first question is what is IT?   We say that all the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">When we consider the emergence of AI (General and Generative), the question isn’t if this technology will change our lives, but rather where we are on its S-curve. Reflecting on the past 150 years, we’ve seen numerous S-curve life cycles. The most recent significant curves included the internet and the mobile phone, which have now reached their mature and stable stages. No one is camping out for the next iPhone release or fretting over the next-gen website.  These are at the end of the cycle. So, where do we stand with General AI and Generative AI?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class="">This post arises from the sudden surge of interest and applications surrounding ChatGPT (Generative AI and not General AI) . It’s a good moment to ponder our position on the AI curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p class=""><strong>So, where are current technologies on This Curve?</strong> What changes are on the horizon? Is effortless coding and general writing and test-taking a thing of the past? Will innovative Python programming still be relevant? Could the traditional Google search be replaced by direct answers from Generative AI? Is the act of pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) for general simple things going the way of the abacus in favor of the calcular?</p>
