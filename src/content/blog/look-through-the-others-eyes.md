# Look Through the Other’s Eyes

One of the most challenging and profound lessons I’ve learned in life is the importance of striving—at nearly all costs—to understand the perspective of others. It’s easy to sympathize with others when they express pain, frustration, or joy. We feel empathy and understand on some level that everyone is fighting their own battle. But true growth, true connection, comes from understanding **why** they feel that way.

We all have desires. We all have needs. And more often than not, our desires, no matter how selfish they may appear, come from a place of genuine, albeit sometimes flawed, intention. People are good—they want to do good, or at least they want what they perceive as good, even if it seems selfish. The challenge, then, is not to explain **your** reasoning but to understand **theirs**.

This is where true dialogue begins. When we stop justifying our own thoughts and start asking, “Why does this person think this way?” or “What drives their belief?”, it becomes easier to find common ground. We can disagree on outcomes but still respect and value each other’s journey.

It’s not about being right—it’s about understanding. That is how we create deeper connections and foster compassion. It’s also how we move forward as a society. So, the next time you find yourself frustrated by someone’s actions or thoughts, take a moment. Ask yourself: *What’s their truth?* 

If you can see the world through their eyes, you’ll be amazed at how much easier it becomes to find meaningful dialogue, compassion, and growth.
