# Look Through the Other’s Eyes
(im trying the blog post again)

## One of the most challenging and profound lessons I’ve learned in life 
is the importance of striving—at nearly all costs—to understand the perspective of others. It’s easy to sympathize with others when they express pain, frustration, or joy. We feel empathy and understand on some level that everyone is fighting their own battle. But true growth, true connection, comes from understanding **why** they feel that way.

## We all have desires. We all have needs. 
 And more often than not, our desires, no matter how selfish they may appear, come from a place of genuine, albeit sometimes flawed, good intentions. People are good—they want to do good, or at least they want what they perceive as good, even if it seems selfish. 
 
 ## The challenge then, is not to explain **your** reasoning but to understand **theirs**.

You may find your issue is indeed thiers too.  Maybe the words differ.  You may find the tone of the differnce differ, but not the content.  The path to agreed goals differ but not the goals.

I think this is where true dialogue begins. When we stop justifying our own thoughts and start asking, “Why does this person think this way?” or “What drives their belief?”, it becomes easier to find common ground. We can disagree on outcomes but still respect and value each other’s journey.

## It’s not about being right—it’s about understanding. 
That is how we create deeper connections and foster compassion. It’s also how we move forward as a society. So, the next time you find yourself frustrated by someone’s actions or thoughts, take a moment. Ask yourself: *What’s their truth?* 

# I fail at this all the time.
I have seen people we are good at this.  I will keep building that pattern of understanding that EVERYONE is good.  Everyone comes from a reasnoing that i many not understand, but if i can attempt to always see the world through their eyes, I know the problems just fall away.

# I want life to be easier to find meaningful 
dialogue, compassion, and above all, deep understanding of the good truth that is not mine.
