# Chinese Meals I Ate on This Trip

Traveling through different parts of Hong Kong, I tried some dishes that were both exciting and, for a newcomer, occasionally surprising. Here are a few highlights (or, depending on your taste buds, “fright-lights”) from my culinary adventure:

1. **Goose Web Feet**  
   Yes, goose *feet*. Served braised or in soup, these webbed delicacies are mostly about the **gelatinous texture**. If you can get over the look, the flavor can be quite rich, especially when seasoned with soy sauce, ginger, or star anise.

2. **Smelly Tofu**  
   The name says it all: it has a *very* strong smell, but the taste is milder than you might expect. Traditionally fermented, **smelly tofu** is often deep-fried and served with chili sauce or pickled vegetables. It’s an iconic street food that many locals *love*.

3. **“Cotton” Chicken**  
   This dish (possibly “poached” or “steamed” chicken, sometimes called “Bai Qie Ji”) is known for its **ultra-tender, silky texture**—almost cotton-like. Served cold or at room temperature, it’s often dipped in a ginger-scallion sauce. Simple, light, and all about the chicken’s natural flavor.

4. **Pork and Shrimp Paste Mixed with Ground Lotus**  
   A hearty mix that’s both savory and subtly sweet from the lotus root. The chopped lotus root gives a pleasant crunch, while **pork and shrimp** paste add depth of flavor. Typically shaped into patties or balls and pan-fried or steamed.

5. **Dried Oyster with Shrimp Paste**  
   Oyster and shrimp are strong flavors on their own; put them together, and you get a **briny, umami bomb**. Often cooked with a bit of sauce or veggies, this dish can be intense, but it’s a favorite for seafood lovers.

6. **Chicken Feet**  
   A staple in many dim sum restaurants, chicken feet (or “phoenix claws”) are usually **braised in a savory-sweet sauce** until soft and gelatinous. They’re high in collagen and definitely an acquired taste for some, but widely beloved by many locals.

From the chewy texture of goose feet to the pungent aroma of smelly tofu, these dishes remind me that Chinese cuisine is wildly diverse and full of surprises. Each dish has its unique history, preparation style, and *fan base*. While not every bite may be for everyone, each experience brings a new appreciation for the rich tapestry of Chinese food culture.
