# A Person Is Good—It Takes People to Be Bad

I often reflect on how an individual, on their own, can be wonderfully kind, generous, and empathetic. Yet, when we become part of a larger group, something shifts. The idea of *us* versus *them* creeps in, and suddenly, that inherent goodness can warp into suspicion or hostility.

**A person**—one person—tends to be inherently good. Sure, we might not always do what others view as “right,” but usually our intentions come from a place of trying to do the best we can. We’re all on this little planet, muddling through together. **A group**, however, can create a sense of exclusion, where “us” is over here, and “them” is somewhere else entirely. That’s when the stronger tribal instincts kick in, and we risk becoming less tolerant or more combative.

It’s **amazing** we’ve managed to coexist for this long, given our tendency to divide into teams, factions, and echo chambers. Yet I still believe we can transcend this tribal pull. Recognizing the humanity in each individual, remembering that we all share basic needs and hopes, can help us shift from “us versus them” back to a more universal **we**. It’s not easy, but it might just be the key to getting along on this crowded, remarkable planet.
